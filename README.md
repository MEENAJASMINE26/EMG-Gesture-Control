# EMG-Gesture-Control
Electromyography (EMG) Based Gesture Control: Developed an Arduino-based system to read EMG signals, process voltage levels, and control multiple devices (light, fan, buzzer) based on muscle activity, demonstrating ADC, signal processing, and real-time control logic.

# Electromyography (EMG) Based Gesture Control (Multi-Device)

This project uses an EMG sensor to detect muscle activity and control multiple devices such as lights, fans, and buzzers based on the voltage level of the muscle signal.  
It demonstrates signal acquisition, threshold-based decision-making, and real-time control of multiple outputs.

## Project Overview
- **Input:** EMG sensor signal connected to Arduino's analog pin
- **Processing:** Arduino reads the analog voltage, converts it to a digital value, and compares it with predefined thresholds
- **Output:** Multiple devices are controlled via digital output pins (ON/OFF)
